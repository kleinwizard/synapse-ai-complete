# Synapse v4.0 Guidelines-Based System Upgrade

## Overview
Successfully replaced the Synapse v3.0 template-based system with a new guidelines-based prompt optimization system that uses comprehensive prompt engineering principles to create optimized prompts via GPT-4o.

## Key Changes

### 1. System Architecture Transformation
**Before (v3.0):** Template acted AS the prompt
- Generated XML-like structured templates
- Templates were sent directly to target LLMs
- Required complex template parsing

**After (v4.0):** Guidelines CREATE optimized prompts
- Comprehensive prompt engineering guidelines
- Instructions sent to GPT-4o to generate optimized prompts
- Clean, executable prompts returned for target LLMs

### 2. New Processing Flow
```
v3.0: User Input → XML Template → Target LLM → Response
v4.0: User Input → Guidelines + Instructions → GPT-4o → Optimized Prompt → Target LLM → Response
```

### 3. Files Modified

#### `/backend/app/prompt_builder.py` (Complete Rewrite)
- **Class:** `SynapsePromptBuilder` upgraded to v4.0
- **New Method:** `_load_comprehensive_guidelines()` - Contains extensive prompt engineering guidelines
- **Updated Method:** `build()` - Now generates optimization instructions for GPT-4o
- **Updated Method:** `get_prompt_stats()` - Tracks guidelines-based metrics
- **Preserved:** All existing interfaces (`PromptData` class, method signatures)

#### `/backend/app/main.py` (Updated Integration)
- **Updated:** `/optimize` endpoint to use new guidelines-based system
- **Preserved:** Hybrid processing modes (local Ollama + cloud API)
- **Updated:** Variable names and comments to reflect new system
- **Preserved:** All existing API response formats
- **Preserved:** Enhancement level system and complexity assessment
